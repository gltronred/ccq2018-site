#Purpose and Scope

The workshop should be devoted to discussions on classical and quantum computation and cryptography. Submissions including non-finished ideas to raise discussion are
possible and indeed welcomed. Also, well-written tutorials on specific topics can be accepted as contributions. The main topics include, but are not limited to:

* Quantum and classic computing
* Algorithms
* Computational complexity
* Cryptography
* Quantum and random walks
* Automata theory
* Quantum learning
